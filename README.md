Whilst the financial market mostly resembles a maze, one in which every twist and turn we make of our own accord, has far reaching consequences, it is possible to, and indeed, advisable to, tread with caution. If one were to somehow gain the ability to accurately predict the peaks and troughs of the stock market, then one can gain a huge competitive advantage. This project attempts to do the same thing. By employing Machine learning models, we aim to predict, with a percentage accuracy, the rise and fall of specific stocks in the stock market.
